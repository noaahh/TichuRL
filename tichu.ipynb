    "## What's Tichu?\n",
    "Tichu is a two to four-player Chinese-style card game. The objective of the game is for players to form both pairs and combinations of sets to score points. It is played with a deck of 54 cards plus four special cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "The game is played in rounds, and each team takes turns playing their cards. The cards range in value from 2-10, with Ace being the highest and 2 the lowest.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this OMC, we decided to take a simplified version of the game to allow to focus on the probability calculation and not spend too much time on the coding the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a base we took this code repository: https://github.com/sylee421/TichuRL\n",
    "\n",
    "We, however, reworked and added logic to the infrastructure:\n",
    "    - Added new agents for better competition\n",
    "    - Added tournament logic\n",
    "    - Removed machine learning aspects\n",
    "    - Improved points distribution to be more realistic to the actual rule set.\n",
